# I am learning Python

I have literally zero code knowledge and am teaching myself Python.
I am putting it on Github to share my journey and seek help when I need it.

My project thus far consists of an app called "Postr" which runs on Flask. I haven't got a requirements.txt so bare with me.

## Learning to do things the right way. 

In the interest of "doing it right" any contribution is helpful.
