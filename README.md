# I am learning Python

I have literally zero code knowledge and am teaching myself Python.
I am putting it on Github to share my journey and seek help when I need it.

My project thus far consists of an app called "Postr" which runs on Flask. 

## Getting running:



```pip install -r requirements.txt```

Create the database:
```flask --app=postr initdb```

Create directories:

```mkdir user_data```
```mkdir temp_data```

Run with reload:
```flask --app=postr run --reload```


## Learning to do things the right way. 

In the interest of "doing it right" any contribution is helpful.
